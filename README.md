# ðŸ˜¡ Crashout Stewie

A silly chrome extension where Stewie Griffin (baby from Family Guy) screams at you whenever you make a grammar, math, coding, or quiz related mistake. 
Originally I wanted him to have multiple moods, but due to some API issues, hes stuck on the mood confused yelling "Blast! What is this nonsense?", not my intent, but does what I wanted more or less. 

## Features 
- Detects grammar mistakes using LanguageTool API
- Identifies math errors and quiz wrong answers
- Catches coding mistake (just semicolon if the language requires it right now)
- Custom stewie reactions drawn by me
- Text-to-speech so stewie yells at you, crashing out, as you get answers wrong

## Tech Stack
- Javascript
- Fetch API
- LanguageTool API
- Web Speech API

## Why I Made This 
To perform better when doing my assignments, I perform better when someone else is relying on me, so I chose one of my favorite characters to keep me in check. 
Also Crashout Stewie was a fun experiment to learn about building Chrome extensions, the use of multiple APIs, and injecting personality into debugging.
